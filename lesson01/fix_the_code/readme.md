To run the tests in WebStorm, do the following:

- Use your terminal and enter this directory.
- Use the command *npm install* to get the dependencies.
- Right click *TheCode.test.js* and choose *Run*.

You should now see the results of the tests in the built-in WebStorm test runner. 

Always do *npm install* in all examples before running the code. Whenever you see a *package.json* file, run *npm install* :)
